Want some more corrections,
1. Want to see not only marked but also the unmarked words in the app.
2. Inside the attached page shown, there are different categories shown for N1 goi. I want to see the word list related to that category. So that I can just get the overview of words and I can study them from there.




Can I generate a section to display words with similar meaning, similar hiragana, similar kanji words, almost similar meaning words side by side as remembering them will be easier by reading in this way.





Want to add the story section inside the app. Just remember this is the special section of the app. It is there to teach how the kanjies got their meaning.

First of all let me teach you how it is being generated before generating any code.




So the thing is everytime I search for any kanji. You have to show the entire block having those kanji, their meaning and story.

This is the way I will visually remember the kanji.
