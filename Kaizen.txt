Move ahead with the user input version of the app.












Don't need to generate any code as of now. Just remember the next new 3 features I want to add in my app. You can give suggestions related to these


1.Want the n words random study mode (I will set the n value to study words). I should have option of japanese level, or all level mixed before starting the study mode. This study mode will have 3 types of random flashcards.
a. guess the kanji from hiragana and check correct or wrong based on the answer I have in my mind. (I will choose the correct or incorrect).
b. guess the hiragana from kanji and meaning
c. guess the meaning from the kanji and hiragana


2. New section to display words groupwise
Can I generate a section to display words with similar meaning, similar hiragana, similar kanji words, almost similar meaning words side by side as remembering them will be easier by reading in this way.




3. Story section
Want to add the story section inside the app. Just remember this is the special section of the app. It is there to teach how the kanjies got their meaning.

First of all let me teach you how it is being generated before generating any code.












So the thing is everytime I search for any kanji. You have to show the entire block having those kanji, their meaning and story.

This is the way I will visually remember the kanji.
